correct specifications of parameters, e.g. migration rates in help pages

improve function conv_seq_to_segsites in src/parse_seqgen_output.cpp. Is it possible to count e.g. sites with three nucleotide types like two segregating sites?
also in parser function for seqgen output

options to ignore positions with more than two sites

convert sequences into segsites without outgroup -> folded JSFS

Make interfaces to ape data, maybe also seqinr and others
